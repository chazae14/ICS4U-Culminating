12U Computer Science culminating project, where the objective was to code a fully functioning game in 6 weeks, while imitating the software development cycle. 
Sweet Memories is a tiled graphics, story-based game with multiple endings depending on the playerâ€™s achievements. 
- Use of GitHub & Visual Studios to code
- Completed in C#
- if structures, for loops, form interactions and much more were used to ensure effective code 
- Procedures and functions were used when necessary 
- Commenting was thoroughly used throughout
